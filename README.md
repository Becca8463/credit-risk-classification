# credit-risk-classification
In this challenge I was tasked to train and evaluate a model to predict loan risk.
By using the logic regression model, I was able to display my results and determine if they were
“healthy” or “unhealthy”. The dataframe that I read in from the csv provided had other relevant
information such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of
accounts, derogatory remarks, and total debt. Initially there was our target (y) listed as a
column. I was able to drop that column in order to separate it from the (X) variable. From there I
split the data into X and y train and X and y test. I made sure to use the random state of 1 in
order to be able to reproduce the work. I trained the data using the Logistic Regression model.
From there I generated a confusion matrix then displayed the classification report for the model.
I took this data and created an analysis report.

Overall I enjoyed this assignment and was able to go off of memory and previous class activities to complete it.
